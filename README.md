# easyrulesplusmvel

Java project combining [Easy Rules](http://www.easyrules.org/) and [MVEL](http://mvel.codehaus.org/) demonstrating how to implement a lightweight rules engine in Java and enabling decisions to be represented as strings, hence externalised in properties files or databases, or manipulated via JMX, using [Jolokia](https://jolokia.org/) and [Hawtio](http://hawt.io/).
